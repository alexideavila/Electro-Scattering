# Updates to Data Visualizer

**First Version**
> The prototype, can read files from some pre-set origin.
Have to manually add the specific location in order for
it to work. And the data file in question has to be
modified.

**Second Version**
> Now it will prompt the user for the name of the file but
it has to be at a predetermined location. Data file still
has to be modified.

**Third Version**
> Now it can read the usual data file because it skips over
lines and only saves the numbers necessary. And I made an
executable for Windows.
